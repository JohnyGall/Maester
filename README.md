### What is Squire?
Squire is a platform, written in Python and using [Appium](http://appium.io/),
for running unit tests on multiple Android devices/emulators in series.

### Why Does Squire Exist?
The Android ecosystem is fragmented, with a huge number of possible device and
operating system version combinations.Each of these combinations has their own
little quirks so running unit tests on as many combinations as possible is the
key to ensuring that an app works for many users. Unfortunately, running unit
tests on a series of devices using the raw Appium Python bindings is a
surprising amount of work. Squire abstracts away much of this work, meaning you
can focus on writing great unit tests that run across devices.
